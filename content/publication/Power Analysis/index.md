abstract: Conjoint experiments aiming to estimate average marginal component effects and related quantities have become a standard tool for social scientists. However, existing solutions for power analyses to find appropriate sample sizes for such studies have various shortcomings and accordingly, explicit sample size planning is rare. Based on recent advances in statistical inference for factorial experiments, we derive simple yet generally applicable formulae to calculate power and minimum required sample sizes for testing average marginal component effects (AMCEs), conditional AMCEs, as well as interaction effects in forced-choice conjoint experiments. The only input needed are expected effect sizes. Our approach only assumes random sampling of individuals or randomization of profiles and avoids any parametric assumption. Furthermore, we show that clustering standard errors on individuals is not necessary and does not affect power. Our results caution against designing conjoint experiments with small sample sizes, especially for detecting heterogeneity and interactions. We provide an R package that implements our approach.

abstract: Despite fierce politicization and heated public debates in arms-exporting democracies, systematic research on mass public preferences on arms trade is lacking. Combining political economy models of arms trade with the literatures on trade preferences and foreign policy attitudes, we argue that citizens trade off economic incentives, strategic interests and moral considerations when assessing arms trade and that deeply rooted `strategic culturesâ€™ lead to differences in citizen preferences between countries. To derive the implicit weighting of different features of arms trade, we draw on population-representative conjoint survey experiments (N=6,617), fielded in November/December 2020 in two of the global top-5 exporting countries of major arms: Germany and France. We find that both country populations show structured preferences towards arms exports which predominantly center around their moral repercussions. However, German respondents place more weight on moral consequences and, compared to French respondents, a larger share is in fundamental opposition. We conclude that these diverging preferences potentially conflict with plans of a common European defense and security policy.
