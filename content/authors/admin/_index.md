Welcome! I will soon be starting a data science job in the pharmaceutical industry. Previously, I was a Research Fellow at the Chair of Empirical Political Research and Policy Analysis at the Geschwister-Scholl-Institut of Political Science (LMU Munich). I will continue some of my academic projects and teaching in my spare time.

I have a strong interest in statistical methodology, causal inference (especially causal graphs) and statistical programming with R and Julia. Furthermore, my research interests include political behaviour, political economy, and discrimination. I taught M.A.-level lab sessions and assisted with teaching at the 2020 ECPR Winter School in Methods and Techniques. 

In summer 2021, I taught an intro to programming with R. The course website can be found [<span style="color:#644155"> here </span>](https://m-freitag.github.io/intro-r-polsci/).
